A Totem plugin that adds a configurable timer to cause totem to exit upon expiry.
The plugin provides two ways to configure the timer:
  - choose the menu item Movie->Timer
  - or right click in player window and choose Timer from the pop-up menu
  - or type Ctrl+D

Note that the timer operates independent of the media state, for example:
  - a timer can be started when no media is playing
  - a timer that expires when no media is playing will still cause totem to exit
  - if the media finishes before the timer expires, the timer continues on and
upon timer expiry, totem will exit.
  - a timer does not restart or cancel itself when the playing media is started,
stopped, paused or changed
  - only one timer runs at a one time, configuring a timer while one is already
running will cancel the first timer.
